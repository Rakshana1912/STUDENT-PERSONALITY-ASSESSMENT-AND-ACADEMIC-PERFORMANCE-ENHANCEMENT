# STUDENT-PERSONALITY-ASSESSMENT-AND-ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE-ENHANCEMENT

ABSTRACT 
 
Understanding the relationship between personality traits and academic 
performance is crucial for fostering personalized and effective educational 
strategies. However, traditional approaches to personality assessment often rely on 
subjective tools, such as self-reported surveys and observations, which are prone to 
bias and limited scalability. This project introduces an innovative system that 
integrates machine learning techniques for comprehensive student personality 
assessment and its correlation with academic performance. The proposed system 
employs a modular approach, incorporating data collection, preprocessing, feature 
analysis, and predictive modeling to identify patterns between personality traits—
 based on the Big Five model—and academic metrics such as grades, participation, 
and attendance. Machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient 
Boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are used for regression, 
classification, and time-series analysis. The models are evaluated using metrics like 
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with the LSTM achieving the highest 
accuracy at 92.4% in predicting academic trends. Additionally, clustering 
algorithms such as K-Means group students with similar traits to enable targeted 
interventions. The system provides personalized insights and recommendations to 
students, educators, and administrators through an interactive dashboard built with 
Streamlit, empowering stakeholders with actionable data for improving educational 
outcomes. This project exemplifies the role of artificial intelligence in creating 
intelligent, scalable, and impactful solutions for modern education.
